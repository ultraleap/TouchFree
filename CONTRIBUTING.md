# Contributing

We welcome and encourage contributions from the community! Please create an issue or submit a pull request to address problems you've been having or add new functionality.

## PR Templates

We have multiple pull request templates that are for different situations. See the descriptions at the top of the templates for details.

## Review Threads

Help the contributor when reviewing by using emoji's to show intent with each thread:

* 👀 - “Please do this, I want to look at it again once done / discuss it further” - reviewer is responsible for resolving thread
* 🙈 - “Please do this, I don’t need to look at it again once done” - PR submitter is responsible for resolving thread
* 🤷 - “Suggestion, I don’t mind if you do it or not” - PR submitter is responsible for resolving thread
* 👍 - “This is just a positive comment on your code, no changes needed” - PR submitter is responsible for resolving thread
* 💬 - "I want to discuss this but don't need any changes until we decide on an outcome"

Got ideas for any other emojis that would be helpful? Add them here with an PR 👀
