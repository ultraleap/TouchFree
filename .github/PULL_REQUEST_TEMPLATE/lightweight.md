## Pull Request Templates

Switch template by going to preview and clicking the link - note it will not work if you've made any changes to the description.

- [default.md](?expand=1) - main template to be used in most situations.
- [lightweight.md](?expand=1&template=lightweight.md) - use for small/minor fixes or changes that don't require significant review.
- [release.md](?expand=1&template=release.md) - use for releases.

**You are currently using: lightweight.md**

Note: these links work by overwriting query parameters of the current url. If the current url contains any you may want to amend the url with `&template=name.md` instead of using the link. See [query parameter docs](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/using-query-parameters-to-create-a-pull-request) for more information.
